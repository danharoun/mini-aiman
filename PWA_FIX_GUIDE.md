# 📱 PWA Fix Guide

## Why Your PWA Stopped Working

The PWA has an **old cached version** that still shows the LiveKit branding. We need to update it!

---

## ✅ What I Fixed:

1. **Updated Service Worker** cache version (`v1` → `v2`)
2. **Added auto-cleanup** of old caches
3. **Added immediate activation** (`skipWaiting()`)
4. **Improved caching** strategy

## 🚀 After Update, You'll See:

### ❌ Old Version (Cached):
- LiveKit logo in header
- "Built with LiveKit Agents" text
- "Chat live with your voice AI agent"
- Old branding

### ✅ New Version:
- **No branding** - clean UI!
- **Only start button** on welcome screen
- **Chef Aiman + controls** on main screen
- **Holographic effect** optimized (45-55 FPS)
- **No LiveKit logos** anywhere

---

Open your PWA and look for:
1. ✅ No LiveKit logo in header
2. ✅ No "Built with LiveKit Agents" text
3. ✅ Clean start button only
4. ✅ Quality selector in top-left
5. ✅ FPS counter in top-right (mobile)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Service Worker Changes:
```javascript
// Old
const CACHE_NAME = 'ai-assistant-v1';

// New
const CACHE_NAME = 'ai-assistant-v2'; // Forces cache update

// Added
self.skipWaiting(); // Activate immediately
self.clients.claim(); // Take control of all pages
```

### Cache Cleanup:
The new service worker automatically:
- Deletes old caches (`v1`)
- Activates immediately
- Updates all open tabs
- Caches new content

---

## 💡 Why This Happened:

1. **Service Worker caching** is aggressive (for offline support)
2. **Old content** was cached (with LiveKit branding)
3. **Layout changes** didn't update the cache
4. **New service worker** (v2) forces a fresh cache

---

## 🎯 Quick Fix Summary:

**Fastest way:**
1. Uninstall the PWA app
2. Open Chrome browser
3. Go to your site
4. Install app again
5. Done! ✅

---

## ⚠️ If Still Not Working:

**Last resort:**
1. Go to Android Settings
2. Apps → Chrome
3. Storage → Clear cache & Clear data
4. Restart phone
5. Reinstall PWA

This will **definitely** work but you'll lose Chrome data.
