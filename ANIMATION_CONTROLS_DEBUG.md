# 🔍 Animation Controls Debug - Added Logging

## Problem
Animation controls not showing up in the collapsible menu.

## Debug Changes Added

### 1. **Added headInstance Logging**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🎭 headInstance updated:', !!headInstance);
  if (headInstance) {
    console.log('✅ headInstance is ready, animation controls should be visible');
  }
}, [headInstance]);
```

### 2. **Added Loading Fallback**
Now shows a message when headInstance is not ready:
```typescript
{headInstance ? (
  // Animation controls button
) : (
  <div className="text-xs text-white/30 text-center py-2">
    Animation controls loading...
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. **Added Click Logging**
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  console.log('🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked, current state:', animControlsOpen);
  setAnimControlsOpen(!animControlsOpen);
}}
```

## How to Debug

1. **Open Console** (F12)
2. **Refresh Page** (F5)
3. **Open Controls Menu** (☰ button)
4. **Check Console Logs**:

### Expected Logs:

#### When Page Loads:
```
🎭 headInstance updated: false
[Avatar loads...]
🎭 headInstance updated: true
✅ headInstance is ready, animation controls should be visible
```

#### When Menu Opens:
You should see either:

**If headInstance is ready**:
```
▶️ Animation Controls
```

**If headInstance NOT ready**:
```
Animation controls loading...
```

#### When You Click Animation Controls:
```
🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked, current state: false
[Controls expand]
🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked, current state: true
[Controls collapse]
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Never see "headInstance is ready"
**Cause**: `onHeadReady` callback not being called

**Check**:
1. Open console
2. Look for: `🎭 TalkingHeadTile state: {hasHead: true, isAvatarLoaded: true}`
3. If you see `isAvatarLoaded: false`, avatar didn't load

**Solution**: Check avatar URL and network

---

### Issue 2: See "Animation controls loading..."
**Cause**: `headInstance` is null/undefined

**Check Console For**:
```
🎭 headInstance updated: false
```

**Solution**: 
- Wait a few seconds for avatar to load
- Check if `onHeadReady` is being called in TalkingHeadTile
- Check MediaTiles is passing callback correctly

---

### Issue 3: Button Shows but Nothing Happens
**Cause**: Click handler not firing

**Check Console For**:
```
🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked
```

**If You Don't See This**:
- The click event isn't working
- Try clicking directly on the text, not just the button area

---

### Issue 4: Controls Expand but Empty
**Cause**: `AvatarAnimationControls` component issue

**Check**:
- Look for errors related to `AvatarAnimationControls`
- Verify the component file exists
- Check if `head` prop is being passed correctly

---

## What to Look For in Console

### ✅ Good (Everything Working):
```
🎭 headInstance updated: false
✅ TalkingHead library loaded
📱 Device capabilities: {...}
🎭 headInstance updated: true
✅ headInstance is ready, animation controls should be visible
[Open menu]
🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked, current state: false
[Controls expand and show moods, gestures, etc.]
```

### ❌ Bad (Not Working):
```
🎭 headInstance updated: false
✅ TalkingHead library loaded
[Avatar loads but never see:]
🎭 headInstance updated: true  ← MISSING!
```

**This means**: `onHeadReady` callback is NOT being called!

---

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Refresh page** (F5)
2. **Wait 5 seconds** for avatar to load
3. **Open console** (F12)
4. **Check for**: `✅ headInstance is ready`
5. **Click ☰** (bottom-right)
6. **Scroll down** in menu
7. **Look for**:
   - `▶️ Animation Controls` ✅ (Good!)
   - `Animation controls loading...` ❌ (Bad - wait longer)
8. **Click "Animation Controls"**
9. **Check console**: `🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked`
10. **Controls should expand** showing moods/gestures

---

## Report Back

After refreshing, please check console and report:

1. Do you see: `✅ headInstance is ready`?
2. Do you see: `▶️ Animation Controls` button?
3. When you click it, do you see: `🎭 Animation controls toggle clicked`?
4. Do the controls expand?
